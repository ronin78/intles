# intles

A toy project for machine learning. Inspired by rock-paper-scissors, a correct move in the game of intles is to throw an exactly inverse vector to your opponent. I am starting with vectors of length three, so the correct move on observing the vector [1 0 1] is [0 1 0]. I am working on training models that will predict what the opponent (human or machine) will throw on the next iteration and throwing the appropriate inverse.
